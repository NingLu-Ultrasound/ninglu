Lecture Preview
======
This lecture will introduce students to state-of-the-art topics in the field of ultrasound imaging. We will start with brief reviews of the ultrasound fundamentals, and then move on to discuss the hardware (transducer, array, and system), imaging sequences, and beamforming methods. We will conclude by discussing the real-world challenges, emerging applications, and advanced ultrasound techniques including ultrafast imaging, super-resolution imaging, aberration correction, etc. Live demo and hands-on experience using a commercial ultrasound system will be provided to the students. If time permits, we'll also introduce ultrasound simulation software which can be helpful for students who are interested in ultrasound-related projects.


Course Summary
======

Unlike conventional imaging courses, the content is not limited to a specific sensor modality, instead, the lectures and labs broadly cover technical terms related to any multidimensional imaging sensors, such as Lidar, time-of-flight (ToF) camera, radar, and ultrasound. This course also has labs and projects, offering fun hands-on experiments. You will have the opportunity to propose and implement a designed project. Past cool projects include:

* A 3D object scanner using a ToF camera for 3D representations
* Counting people through the wall using a mmwave radar
* A touchless musical instrument using ultrasound

What students said:

* "Interesting lectures, fun labs, manageable workload. Would highly recommend!"
* "This is the most fun technical class I've taken at Stanford"
* "I would highly recommend this class for people interested in sensors used for imaging in automotive and robotics applications. We learn about ultrasonic, Time of Flight (TOF), Radar, and Lidar sensors and their applications. Labs also reinforced material and were one of the first labs I actively enjoyed as you get to work with the sensors and see how they operate."
