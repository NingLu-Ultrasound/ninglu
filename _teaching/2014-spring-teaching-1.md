Lecture Preview
======
This lecture will introduce students to state-of-the-art topics in the field of ultrasound imaging. We will start with brief reviews of the ultrasound fundamentals, and then move on to discuss the hardware (transducer, array, and system), imaging sequences, and beamforming methods. We will conclude by discussing the real-world challenges, emerging applications, and advanced ultrasound techniques including ultrafast imaging, super-resolution imaging, aberration correction, etc. Live demo and hands-on experience using a commercial ultrasound system will be provided to the students. If time permits, we'll also introduce ultrasound simulation software which can be helpful for students who are interested in ultrasound-related projects.
