Abstract: Phase aberration correction (AC) is crucial in transcranial histotripsy to correct for the skull-induced focal distortion. This paper enhances a 2-step AC method for clinical use, combining a CT-based analytical approach with a cavitation-based approach using acoustic cavitation emission (ACE). A 700 kHz, 360-element hemispherical transducer was used to generate histotripsy-induced cavitation and acquire ACE shockwaves. Testing on excised human skulls showed that the 2-step AC achieved 90 Â± 7% peak focal pressure, reduced focal shift, and improved refocusing compared to individual AC methods. This real-time AC workflow enhances transcranial histotripsy for brain therapy.
