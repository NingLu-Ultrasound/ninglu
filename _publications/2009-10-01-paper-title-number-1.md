Abstract: This study develops the first transcranial MR-guided histotripsy (tcMRgHt) system for in vivo brain treatment. A 700 kHz, 128-element MR-compatible ultrasound transducer was designed, achieving peak negative pressures of 137 MPa in free field and 72 MPa through a skull with aberration correction. The system is MR-compatible and enabled electronic focal steering. In vivo testing in pigs demonstrated successful targeted brain tissue ablation without excessive bleeding or edema. The results confirm the feasibility of using tcMRgHt for transcranial treatment in a swine model.
