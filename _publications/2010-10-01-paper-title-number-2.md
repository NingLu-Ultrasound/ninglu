Abstract: This study evaluates the in vivo feasibility of transcranial MR-guided histotripsy (tcMRgHt) for brain surgery. Using a 700 kHz, 128-element MR-compatible transducer inside a 3T MRI scanner, histotripsy was delivered to eight pigs through an excised human calvarium after craniotomy. MRI scans before and after treatment confirmed well-confined lesions without excessive edema or hemorrhage. Histology showed precise tissue ablation, correlating with MRI findings. These results demonstrate the first in vivo feasibility of tcMRgHt in the pig brain, supporting further investigation for clinical brain surgery applications.
