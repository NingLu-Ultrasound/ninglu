Highlight: A 750 kHz, 360-element ultrasound array was developed for transcranial histotripsy. This study evaluates its performance using experiments and simulations in human skulls. Results show that treatment efficacy depends on skull properties, with shallow targets facing greater challenges due to attenuation and pre-focal pressure hotspots. Strategies such as array design optimization and pose adjustment are proposed to enhance treatment. These findings guide the development of next-generation histotripsy arrays for clinical applications.
